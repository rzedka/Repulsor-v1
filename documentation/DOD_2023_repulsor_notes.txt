Can I do it in Arduino nano with FCLK = 16 MHz??

In the Nucleo Board I had:
 - FCLK = 80 MHz
 - Fsmp = 1 kHz
 - 10bit ADC
 - PWM value is truncated to 10 bits
 - htim1 freq. = 1000 Hz
 - htim2 freq. = 19 531.25 Hz (10 bits)
 
 
 For the Adruino Nano I have:
 - FCLK = 16 MHz
 - Fsmp = 1 kHz (or 500 Hz)
 - 10 bit ADC
 - Timer with PWM frequency ~ 20 kHz
 - maybe a button and a few LEDs.
 - debouncer for the button
 - UART will be optional
 
 It should be doable... only the number of 16bit register operations might be tricky...
